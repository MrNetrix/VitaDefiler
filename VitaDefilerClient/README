This is the client for VitaDefiler.

You need to first build NativeFunctions.cil with the following command (in this directory):
```
mkdir lib
ilasm.exe /output:lib\NativeFunctions.dll /dll NativeFunctions.cil
```

You can run it from either Visual Studio Command Prompt or with Mono's irasm.exe

Next, open the project in PSM Develop, build it, and make sure it runs on the Vita. 
Check that there's no errors in loading & deploying and if all is good, you can 
use VitaDefilerClient.psdp with VitaDefiler.
